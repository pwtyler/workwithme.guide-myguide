## Values & Personality

- Never stop **learning**. We've always said my grandmother has stayed independent and healthy because she's always been willing to keep learning. We should all aspire to be like Merrie, calling an Uber on her iPhone to go to the gym by herself at 93.
- I consistently try to find the **creativity** and **artistry** in what I do as well. [Code is Poetry](https://wordpress.org/), &c.
- You won't get very far without being **honest** with your peers open about what you know and don't know. If others don't know you need help, they won't be able to help you.
- I am **methodical** and strive to "do it right the first time".

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Positive feedback: Calls/slack conversation is great! Props in meetings/orientation are always good.
Negative feedback: 1:1 call or Slack will be the most comfortable.

## Work Patterns

I work East Coast hours, So my end-of-day can sometimes throw a wrench into planning meetings with team members working on the West coast. I value the couple hours in the morning before meetings and messages start coming in from West coast peers, and find it can be some of my most productive time.

If booking time day-of, try to reach out directly before adding something to my calendar.

At least once a day I take a quick break to run the dog around the block to recharge both of us.

I like pair programming (especially when learning something new) and try to be quick to jump to post questions in slack if and when I hit a block— and about half the time I end up rubber ducking the answer in the process of writing out my question. 

## Communication Preferences

Reaching out to me on Slack, either direct messages or channel pings, is best. I try to keep an eye on slack (even if just on my cell) for an extra couple hours at the end of the day to answer questions, but other times may as well be off-the-grid and not check in until the next day. My slack can get a bit noisy sometimes, so if I don't respond within a few minutes, don't feel shy about pinging again. 

I'll ocasionnaly flip on Do Not Disturb during work hours for a chance at head-down, undisturbed time.

On the rare occasions I _am_ working in the office, I don't mind interruptions as I value the limited face-to-face time we have, so feel free to reach out in person if you need something from me, or stick with slack if you prefer.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

If I feel out of my element I tend to quiet down, and while actively listening, will not voice/contribute much.

### How to help

If I seem like I've fallen down a rabbit hole or lost the forest for the trees, feel free to remind me to take a step back and engage with the bigger picture. Engage with specific questions about the problem/issue we're trying to solve.

I can get bogged down in making something "just right", so at any time, remind me that [_Perfect is the Enemy of Good_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good).

## Me Being Me

I'm not great at initiating/maintaining conversation with people I've just met or are getting to know, but continue to keep an effort at it. Don't be turned off by a struggle to keep the conversation going.

## Areas for Development

* Fighting imposer syndrome and confidence in what I do/how I do it.
* Upping my game networking and talking to people cold. I'll rarely seek out/initiate conversations with new people, but *want* to engage and get to know people at work, conferences, etc.
* Presentation and public speaking. Even presenting to a small group on a call can be tough for me, no matter if its four people or 400.

## Ask Me About

* Travel. I love an adventurous vacation.
* My pup, Layla
* Abstract strategy games that are _not_ chess. Have you heard the good news of [Tak](https://playtak.com)?
* Dungeons and/or Dragons. I tell people all the creative energy of my BFA in theatre production is now poured into playing and running RPGs.
* Soviet constructivism in theatrical design
